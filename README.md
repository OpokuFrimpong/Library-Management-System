# Library-Management-System
This Python project implements a simple Library Management System with classes for Book, Member, Library, and LibraryManager. The system allows users to add books, register members, borrow and return books, and display borrowed books using a menu-driven interface.

Features
Book Management:

Add new books to the library.
Display all available books in the library.
Check the availability of books before borrowing.
Member Management:

Register new members to the library.
Each member can borrow multiple books but cannot borrow the same book twice.
Members can return borrowed books.
Library Operations:

Borrow and return books based on book title and member name.
Display a member's borrowed books.
Singleton pattern implementation to ensure only one instance of the library manager exists.
